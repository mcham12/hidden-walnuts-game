# Task 1: Authentication & Session Management - Test Guide

## ✅ What's Implemented

**Industry-Standard Authentication & Session Management** following best practices:

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Secure token-based authentication** via `/join` endpoint
- **Automatic player ID generation** with UUID
- **Session validation** for all subsequent requests
- **Token expiration** with 30-minute timeout

### 🎮 Session Management  
- **SquirrelSession Durable Objects** for persistent player state
- **Position restoration** across sessions
- **Player statistics** tracking (walnuts, score, time online)
- **Graceful disconnect** handling with session preservation

### 🌐 Multiplayer Foundation
- **ForestManager Durable Object** for WebSocket coordination
- **WebSocket upgrade** with authentication validation
- **Connection lifecycle** management (connect → authenticate → active → disconnect)
- **Player synchronization** with real-time position updates

### 🎯 Client Integration
- **NetworkManager** for connection handling with reconnection
- **MultiplayerManager** for avatar rendering and interpolation
- **UI status indicator** showing connection state and player count
- **Position interpolation** for smooth player movement

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Push Changes & Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Task 1: Authentication & Session Management"
git push origin mvp-7a
```

### 2. Wait for Cloudflare Preview Build
- Check GitHub Actions for successful build
- Get preview URL from GitHub commit status

### 3. Test Authentication Flow
1. **Open preview URL in browser**
2. **Check console logs** for authentication:
   ```
   [Network] Starting authentication...
   [Network] Authenticated as [squirrelId]
   [Multiplayer] Connected as [squirrelId]
   ```

### 4. Test Session Persistence
1. **Refresh the page** - should restore position
2. **Check position consistency** across reloads
3. **Verify player ID persistence** in console

### 5. Test Multiplayer UI
1. **Check top-right status indicator**:
   - Should show "Connected ([player-id])"
   - Player count should show "Players: 1"
   - Background should be green when connected

### 6. Test Multi-Browser
1. **Open same preview URL in second browser**
2. **Verify player count increases** to "Players: 2"
3. **Check for player avatars** in both browsers
4. **Test movement** - other player should see movement

### 7. Test Connection Resilience
1. **Close one browser tab**
2. **Verify player count decreases** in remaining browser
3. **Check graceful disconnect** in server logs

## 🔍 Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Authentication completes without errors
- WebSocket connection establishes successfully
- Player spawns at server-provided position
- Position persists across page refreshes
- Multiple players can see each other
- UI shows correct connection status

### ❌ Failure Indicators  
- Console errors during authentication
- WebSocket connection failures
- Position resets on page refresh
- Players can't see each other
- UI shows "Disconnected" when should be connected

## 🚀 Next Steps

After Task 1 validation:
- **Task 2**: Authoritative Server Architecture
- **Task 3**: WebSocket Connection Lifecycle  
- **Task 4**: Core Multiplayer Events
- **Task 5**: Client-Side Prediction & Reconciliation
- **Task 6**: Interest Management
- **Task 7**: Testing & Validation

## 💡 Technical Notes

This implementation follows **industry-standard multiplayer patterns**:
- **Session-based authentication** vs basic auth
- **Durable Objects** for persistent state vs in-memory
- **Token validation** for security vs trust-based
- **Connection monitoring** for cleanup vs memory leaks
- **Position validation** for anti-cheat vs client trust

The foundation is now ready for advanced multiplayer features like client prediction, server reconciliation, and interest management.
