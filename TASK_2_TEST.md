- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Timeout detection, latency calculation, connection quality assessment
- **Error History**: Track last 50 errors with automatic cleanup
- **Connection Quality Levels**: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Critical

### üñ•Ô∏è **Enhanced Server-Side ForestManager**
- **Server Error Tracking**: Categorized server errors with detailed diagnostics
- **Connection Monitoring**: Player connection quality, message counts, error rates

### üé® **Enhanced UI Components**
- **Connection Quality Display**: Real-time connection status with color coding
- **Network Error Panel**: Live error display with auto-cleanup
- **Server Metrics Panel**: Server-side connection statistics
- **Detailed Metrics**: Latency, packet loss, uptime, message counts
- **Error Recovery Indicators**: Visual indicators for recoverable vs non-recoverable errors

### üìä **Comprehensive Logging**
- **Enhanced Logger Integration**: All network events use proper Logger system
- **Error Categorization**: Network, Authentication, WebSocket, Message parsing errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Connection quality monitoring with automatic logging
- **Debug Information**: Detailed error context and recovery information

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Push Changes & Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Task 2: Enhanced Error Handling and Logging for WebSocket Communication"
git push origin mvp-7b
```

### 2. Wait for Cloudflare Preview Build
- Check GitHub Actions for successful build
- Get preview URL from GitHub commit status

### 3. Test Connection Quality Monitoring
1. **Open preview URL in browser**
2. **Check top-right status panel**:
   - Should show "Connection: EXCELLENT" in green
   - Should display latency, packet loss, uptime metrics
   - Should show message count and error count
3. **Verify metrics update in real-time**:
   - Latency should show actual values (e.g., "45.2ms")
   - Packet loss should be 0% for good connections
   - Uptime should increase over time

### 4. Test Server Metrics Panel
1. **Check bottom-right server metrics panel**:
   - Should show "Active Players: 1"
   - Should show "Total Connections: 1"
   - Should display server uptime
   - Should show average latency
   - Should show total errors (should be 0 initially)

### 5. Test Multi-Browser Connection
1. **Open same preview URL in second browser**
2. **Verify metrics update**:
   - Active Players should increase to 2
   - Total Connections should increase
   - Both browsers should show connection quality

### 6. Test Error Handling (Simulated)
1. **Open browser dev tools**
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Simulate network issues**:
   - Throttle network to "Slow 3G"
   - Check if connection quality changes to "POOR" or "CRITICAL"
   - Verify error count increases
   - Check if errors appear in left-side error panel

### 7. Test Reconnection Resilience
1. **Disconnect network temporarily** (or use dev tools to simulate offline)
2. **Verify reconnection behavior**:
   - Should attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Should show reconnection attempts in console
   - Should recover when network is restored
   - Should maintain player position across reconnects

### 8. Test Error Display
1. **Check left-side error panel**:
   - Should be empty initially (no errors)
   - Should show errors with timestamps
   - Should show error types and messages
   - Should show recoverable indicators (üîÑ or ‚ùå)
   - Errors should auto-remove after 10 seconds

### 9. Test Console Logging
1. **Open browser console**
2. **Verify enhanced logging**:
   - Should see emoji-prefixed log messages
   - Should see connection quality updates
   - Should see heartbeat latency measurements
   - Should see error categorization
   - Should see performance metrics

### 10. Test Server-Side Error Handling
1. **Check server logs** (if available):
   - Should see enhanced error tracking
   - Should see connection quality metrics
   - Should see player authentication logs
   - Should see message validation logs

## üîç Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Connection quality displays "EXCELLENT" or "GOOD" in green
- Latency shows realistic values (under 200ms)
- Packet loss shows 0% for stable connections
- Server metrics panel shows accurate player counts
- No errors appear in error panel during normal operation
- Console shows clean, categorized log messages
- Reconnection works smoothly after network interruptions

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators
- Connection quality shows "POOR" or "CRITICAL" in red
- High latency values (over 500ms)
- High packet loss percentages
- Errors appearing in error panel during normal operation
- Console shows excessive error messages
- Reconnection fails or takes too long
- Server metrics show incorrect values

### üîß Troubleshooting
- **High latency**: Check network connection, may be normal for remote servers
- **Connection quality "POOR"**: Check browser network throttling settings
- **No server metrics**: Check if `/server-metrics` endpoint is accessible
- **Console errors**: Verify Logger system is working correctly
- **Reconnection issues**: Check exponential backoff settings

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Connection Quality Thresholds
- **Excellent**: < 50ms latency, 0% packet loss
- **Good**: < 100ms latency, < 1% packet loss
- **Fair**: < 200ms latency, < 5% packet loss
- **Poor**: < 500ms latency, < 10% packet loss
- **Critical**: > 500ms latency, > 10% packet loss

### Error Recovery
- **Recoverable Errors**: Connection timeouts, heartbeat failures, message parse errors
- **Non-Recoverable Errors**: Authentication failures, invalid tokens
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Manual Recovery**: Page refresh for non-recoverable errors

## üöÄ Next Steps

After Task 2 validation:
- **Task 3**: WebSocket Connection Lifecycle Enhancement
- **Task 4**: Core Multiplayer Events Optimization
- **Task 5**: Client-Side Prediction & Reconciliation
- **Task 6**: Interest Management Implementation
- **Task 7**: Testing & Validation

## üí° Technical Notes

This implementation follows **industry-standard multiplayer error handling patterns**:
- **Comprehensive Error Categorization** vs generic error handling
- **Connection Quality Monitoring** vs basic connectivity checks
- **Enhanced Reconnection Logic** vs simple retry mechanisms
- **Real-time Metrics Display** vs hidden debugging information
- **Automatic Error Recovery** vs manual intervention requirements
- **Performance-Based Quality Assessment** vs binary connected/disconnected states

The foundation now provides robust error handling and monitoring for advanced multiplayer features like client prediction, server reconciliation, and interest management.
