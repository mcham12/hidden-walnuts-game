MVP 8b: Character System Refactor & Animation Integration
🎯 Objective
Refactor the game to support multiple character types for players and NPCs, removing hardcoded squirrel assumptions. Implement animated characters with selection, locking, and extensibility. Add NPC system for dynamic forest population. This MVP focuses on a modular, future-proof character architecture to enable ongoing content additions without major rewrites.
📊 Current Status

Status: 📋 PENDING (Ready to start)
Priority: 🔵 HIGH (Core for gameplay variety and immersion)
Dependencies: MVP 7 (Multiplayer Foundation) ✅ COMPLETED
Estimated Time: 4-6 weeks (extended for robustness after previous attempts)
Success Focus: Tasks are granular, sequential, with built-in validation, testing, and iteration points to minimize failure risk. Each task includes explicit milestones, dependencies, and rollback strategies.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
MVP 8b introduces a modular character system with enterprise-grade extensibility:
Character System Components

Character Registry - Centralized character definitions (types, models, animations, unlocks)
Animation Manager - State-based animation control with blending
Character Selection UI - Pre-game selector with locking/unlocking
NPC Controller - AI-driven behaviors for non-player characters
Multiplayer Sync - Character type and animation state synchronization
Performance Optimizer - LOD, culling, and batching for multiple characters

Refactor Principles

No Hardcoding: All character-specific logic abstracted (e.g., via interfaces)
Extensibility: Easy addition of new characters via config/data files
Backward Compatibility: Preserve existing squirrel functionality as default
Testing Focus: Each component testable in isolation

Data Flow

Selection: UI → Registry → Spawn Factory
Spawning: Factory → ECS Entity → Animation Setup
Update: Input/AI → Animation State → Sync → Render
NPC AI: Behavior Tree → Movement → Animation

📋 Task Overview
Tasks are ordered sequentially with dependencies. Each includes:

Milestones: Measurable completion points
Validation: Specific checks/tests
Rollback: Recovery if issues arise
AI Notes: Guidance for AI-assisted implementation

🚀 Key Features
Character Registry

JSON/config-based definitions (model paths, animations, stats, unlock conditions)
Runtime loading for easy expansion
Validation for missing assets/animations

Animation System

State machine with blending (idle, walk, run, etc.)
Extensible per-character animation maps
Performance: Instanced meshes, animation culling

Player Selection

UI with previews, locked/unlocked states
Persistent unlocks (localStorage/server)
Default to squirrel for backward compatibility

NPC System

Behavior trees for AI (patrol, interact, flee)
Any character type usable as NPC
Population manager for forest density

Multiplayer Integration

Character type sync on join
Animation state broadcasting (optimized)
Visual consistency across clients

🎮 Technical Specifications
Performance Targets

Frame Rate: 60 FPS with 20+ animated characters
Memory Usage: <50MB for character system
Network Bandwidth: <1KB/s per animated character
Load Time: <2s for character models/animations

Extensibility Requirements

Add new character: Config update + asset upload only
New animations: Map to states without code changes
Unlock system: Data-driven conditions

Browser Compatibility

Task Documentation: Each task gets 4 files: README.md, testing.md, implementation.md, completion.md
Navigation Updates: Always update docs/DOCUMENTATION.md with new links
No Root Documentation: Never create documentation files in project root

📝 File Naming Conventions

Task directories: 01-registry/, 02-refactor/, etc.
Task files: README.md, testing.md, implementation.md, completion.md
MVP directories: mvp-8b/, mvp-9/, etc.
Navigation: DOCUMENTATION.md (not README.md in docs)

🔄 Documentation Workflow

Reference docs/DOCUMENTATION.md for complete structure
Create task documentation in appropriate docs/mvp-8b/tasks/ directory
Use consistent file naming for all task documentation
Update navigation in docs/DOCUMENTATION.md
Cross-reference related documents appropriately
