# Hidden Walnuts Game Vision
## Overview
*Hidden Walnuts* is a 3D online synchronous multiplayer game set in a persistent forest map that refreshes every 24 hours. Players hide and seek walnuts in a dynamic 3D world with predators and competitive scoring.
## Core Features
### Game World
- **Persistent Forest Map**: 3D world resetting every 24 hours
- **Walnut Placement**: 100 game-hidden walnuts + 3 per player
- **Hot Zones**: Map indicators for recent activity
### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Entry**: Players join anytime, get Player ID + 3 walnuts
- **Hiding**: Press "H" to hide walnuts (buried/bushes)
- **Seeking**: Search for walnuts, steal/rehide others'
- **Predators**: Hawks/wolves with defenses (chatter, projectiles)
- **Power-Ups**: Scent Sniff, Fast Dig, Decoy Nut
### Scoring & Participation
- **Points**: Game walnuts (3 buried, 1 bushes), Player walnuts (2 buried, 1 bushes)
- **Multiplier**: Scales with time played (1.1x to 2x)
- **Leaderboard**: Real-time 24-hour cycle scoring
### Asynchronous Play
- **Persistent Walnuts**: Remain if players log off
- **Catch-Up**: "Fresh Player Boost" for late joiners
- **Mini-Events**: "Nut Rush" every 4 hours

## Implementation Status (Updated August 28, 2025)
- âœ… Simplified Architecture: Single `Game.ts` for core logic, terrain, forest, and basic multiplayer foundation
- âœ… Terrain System: Procedural generation with height mapping
- âœ… Player Movement: WASD controls with camera following
- âœ… Asset Loading: Basic 3D models and animations (focus: single-player character with idle/run/jump)
- ðŸ”„ Walnut Mechanics: Not yet implemented (next priority after single-player polish)
- ðŸ“‹ Scoring System: Backend ready (Leaderboard DO), client integration pending
- ðŸ“‹ Daily Reset: Backend configured, not active in single-player mode
