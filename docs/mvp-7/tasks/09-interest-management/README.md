# Task 9: Interest Management

## 🎯 **Objective**
Implement spatial optimization with area of interest culling for scalable multiplayer performance.

## 📊 **Status**
- **Status**: 📋 **PENDING**
- **Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** (Performance optimization)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 7-8 completed

## 🔧 **What's Planned**

### **Area of Interest**
- **Spatial culling** for visible range only
