# Task 6: WebSocket Connection Lifecycle

## 🎯 **Objective**
Implement secure WebSocket connections with heartbeats, reconnection logic, and proper connection lifecycle management.

## 📊 **Status**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Completion Date**: December 2024
- **Files Modified**: NetworkSystem, ForestManager, connection handling
- **Testing Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

## 🔧 **What's Implemented**

### **Secure Connections**
- **WebSocket upgrade** with authentication validation
- **Secure connection establishment** and validation
- **Connection state management** and monitoring
- **Proper connection cleanup** and resource management

### **Heartbeat System**
- **90-second heartbeat intervals** (optimized for free tier)
- **Connection quality monitoring** and assessment
- **Timeout detection** and automatic reconnection
- **Latency calculation** and performance tracking

### **Reconnection Logic**
- **Automatic reconnection** with exponential backoff
- **Connection state persistence** across reconnects
- **Graceful degradation** during connection issues
- **Session restoration** after reconnection

### **Lifecycle Management**
- **Connection establishment** → **Active** → **Disconnect** → **Cleanup**
- **Player state persistence** across connection cycles
- **Resource cleanup** for disconnected players
- **Connection monitoring** and health checks
