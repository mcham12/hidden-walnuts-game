# Task 8: Client-Side Prediction & Reconciliation

## üéØ **Objective**
Implement zero-latency input with server reconciliation for smooth multiplayer gameplay.

## üìä **Status**
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - CLAMPING REMOVED**
- **Priority**: üîµ **HIGH** (Critical for responsive gameplay)
- **Dependencies**: Task 7 completed ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Issues & Resolution**

### **What Was Implemented and Reverted**
- ‚úÖ **Client prediction and server reconciliation** remain active and working
- ‚ùå **All position clamping and world bounds validation** (server and client) was REMOVED
- ‚ùå **No world bounds enforcement** is currently active; this will be re-implemented more carefully in the future

### **Root Cause**
Aggressive position clamping and validation broke terrain, forest, and player controls. Removing these changes restored the game to a working state.

### **Current State**
- The codebase is now back to the pre-clamping state
- Core prediction and reconciliation features are working
- Worker and client builds are passing
- The game is restored to a working state

### **Next Steps**
- Re-implement world bounds enforcement with more selective, terrain-aware validation
- Test incrementally to avoid breaking core game features

## üîß **What's Planned**

### **Client Prediction**
- **Immediate input response** for local player
- **Input history management** for reconciliation
- **Prediction accuracy** optimization
- **Smooth movement** interpolation

### **Server Reconciliation**
- **Server authority** validation
- **State correction** when predictions differ
- **Reconciliation threshold** (1cm precision)
- **Error handling** for prediction failures

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Efficient input processing**
- **Minimal network overhead**
- **Memory management** for input history
- **CPU optimization** for prediction calculations

## üöÄ **Expected Impact**

- Accurate server reconciliation
- Smooth multiplayer experience
- Foundation for advanced gameplay
