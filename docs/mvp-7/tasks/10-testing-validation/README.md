# Task 10: Testing & Validation

## 🎯 **Objective**
Comprehensively test all multiplayer sync, prediction, reconciliation, and interest management systems using automated, AI-driven tests.

## 📊 **Status**
- **Framework:** Vitest (AI-optimized)
- **Coverage:** 90%+ on all critical systems
- **Workflow:**
  1. All new features and bugfixes must include or update automated tests
  2. Tests must pass locally (`npm run test:run`) before PR/merge
  3. Coverage reports (`npm run test:coverage`) must meet thresholds
  4. AI (Cursor) is responsible for designing, maintaining, and running all tests

## 🔧 **What's Planned**

### **Automated Testing**
- **Unit tests** for all systems
- **Integration tests** for multiplayer functionality
- **Performance tests** for scalability
- **End-to-end tests** for complete workflows

### **Performance Benchmarking**
- **Load testing** with multiple concurrent players
- **Stress testing** for system limits
- **Memory profiling** for optimization
- **Network performance** analysis

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Bug detection** and reporting
- **Regression testing** for changes
- **Compatibility testing** across browsers
- **User experience** validation

## 📁 **Related Files**

- **[implementation.md](implementation.md)** - Technical implementation details (to be created)
- **[testing.md](testing.md)** - Test procedures and validation (to be created)
- **[completion.md](completion.md)** - Completion summary and metrics (to be created)

## 🚀 **Expected Impact**

This task will provide **comprehensive validation** with:
- Automated quality assurance
- Performance benchmarking
- Bug detection and prevention
- Production readiness validation

## Requirements for MVP-7 and Future MVPs
- All multiplayer sync, prediction, and reconciliation code must be covered by automated tests
- All future MVPs must document and enforce automated test requirements for new features
- Test coverage and requirements must be included in each MVP's README

## Test Locations
- `client/src/test/` — test files and setup
- `client/vitest.config.ts` — config

## Scripts
- `npm run test` — run all tests
- `npm run test:coverage` — generate coverage report
- `npm run test:ui` — interactive test UI
