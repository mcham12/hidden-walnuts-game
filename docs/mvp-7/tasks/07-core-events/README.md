# Task 7: Core Multiplayer Events

## 🎯 **Objective**
Implement core multiplayer event system with `player_join`, `player_update`, `player_leave`, and `world_state` events for robust multiplayer functionality.

## 📊 **Status**
- **Status**: 📋 **NEXT UP**
- **Priority**: 🔵 **HIGH** (Foundation for advanced multiplayer features)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1-6 and UrgentA completed

## 🔧 **What's Planned**

### **Core Event System**
- **`player_join`**: When player connects and is ready
- **`player_update`**: Position/state changes (with validation)
- **`player_leave`**: Clean disconnection
- **`world_state`**: Full state on connect, delta updates afterward

### **Session Management**
- **Future-proof session management** for both anonymous and authenticated users
- **Session validation** on reconnection with configurable timeouts
- **Progressive cleanup states**: active → away → disconnected → expired
- **Client-side cleanup** for invalid sessions

### **Authentication Integration**
- **Authentication-ready interfaces** for future user accounts
- **Cleanup rules**: 10 minutes for anonymous, 30 minutes for authenticated users
- **Data migration hooks** for when authentication is implemented
