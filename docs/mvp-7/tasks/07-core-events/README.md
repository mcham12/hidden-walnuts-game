# Task 7: Core Multiplayer Events

## 🎯 **Objective**
Implement core multiplayer event system with `player_join`, `player_update`, `player_leave`, and `world_state` events for robust multiplayer functionality.

## 📊 **Status**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: 🔵 **HIGH** (Foundation for advanced multiplayer features)
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1-6 and UrgentA completed
- **Completion Date**: July 5, 2025

## ✅ **What Was Accomplished**

### **Core Event System** ✅
- **`player_join`**: Implemented with proper session management and position persistence
- **`player_update`**: Position/state changes with terrain validation and anti-cheat
- **`player_leave`**: Clean disconnection with graceful cleanup
- **`world_state`**: Full state on connect, delta updates afterward

### **Session Management** ✅
- **Session persistence** with position saving across browser refreshes
- **Session validation** with configurable timeouts and reconnection handling
- **Progressive cleanup states**: active → away → disconnected → expired
- **Client-side cleanup** for invalid sessions and connection monitoring

### **Authentication Integration** ✅
- **Authentication-ready interfaces** for future user accounts
- **Cleanup rules**: 10 minutes for anonymous, 30 minutes for authenticated users
- **Data migration hooks** for when authentication is implemented

### **Critical Fixes** ✅
- **Terrain height adjustment**: Fixed player floating by always setting Y to terrain height + offset
- **Multiplayer connection conflicts**: Resolved by using sessionStorage instead of localStorage for unique player IDs
- **Position persistence**: Players maintain position across browser refreshes within same session

## 🚀 **Impact Achieved**

This task established the **core event system** that enables:
- ✅ Robust player lifecycle management
- ✅ Efficient state synchronization with terrain validation
- ✅ Scalable multiplayer architecture
- ✅ Foundation for advanced features
- ✅ Position persistence across browser refreshes
- ✅ Multiplayer support for multiple browser sessions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Components**
- **NetworkSystem**: Handles WebSocket connections and message routing
- **ForestManager**: Server-side player management and session handling
- **SquirrelSession**: Individual player session state management
- **TerrainService**: Height validation and collision detection

### **Event Flow**
1. **Connection**: Player authenticates and receives init message with saved position
2. **Join**: Server broadcasts player_joined to all other players
3. **Updates**: Position updates with terrain validation and anti-cheat
4. **Disconnect**: Graceful cleanup with position saving
