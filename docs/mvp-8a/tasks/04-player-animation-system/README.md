# Task 4: Player Animation System

## 🎯 Objective

Build a comprehensive player animation system using Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture to handle smooth transitions between 16 animation states (Idle_A/B/C, Run, Walk, Jump, Roll, Attack, Bounce, Clicked, Death, Eat, Fear, Fly, Hit, Sit, Swim). Integrate with input system and ensure 60 FPS performance.

## 📋 Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ Implement 16 animation states for player characters
- ✅ Smooth transitions between animation states using FSM
- ✅ Input-driven animation system (WASD movement triggers animations)
- ✅ Animation blending for seamless state changes
- ✅ Support for all character types (Colobus, Gecko, Herring, Inkfish, Muskrat, Pudu, Sparrow, Taipan)
- ✅ Animation state persistence and recovery
- ✅ Performance optimization for 60 FPS target

### **Technical Requirements**
- ✅ AnimationStateMachine for FSM implementation
- ✅ PlayerAnimationController for player-specific logic
- ✅ AnimationSystem for ECS integration
- ✅ Animation blending and interpolation
- ✅ Input system integration
- ✅ Performance monitoring and optimization
- ✅ Error handling and fallback animations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Animation State Machine**
```typescript
interface AnimationState {
  name: string;
  clip: THREE.AnimationClip;
  transitions: AnimationTransition[];
  blendWeight: number;
  duration: number;
}

interface AnimationTransition {
  from: string;
  to: string;
  condition: () => boolean;
  blendTime: number;
}
```

### **Animation States**
1. **Idle States**: Idle_A, Idle_B, Idle_C (random idle variations)
2. **Movement States**: Walk, Run, Jump, Roll, Swim, Fly
3. **Action States**: Attack, Eat, Sit, Hit, Death
4. **Emotional States**: Fear, Bounce, Clicked

### **Integration Points**
- **InputSystem**: Triggers animation state changes
- **MovementSystem**: Provides movement data for animations
- **RenderSystem**: Handles animation rendering
- **Multiplayer System**: Syncs animation states across clients

## 📊 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Core Animation System**
1. **Implement AnimationStateMachine** with FSM architecture
2. **Create PlayerAnimationController** for player-specific logic
3. **Add AnimationSystem** to ECS for system integration
4. **Implement animation blending** and interpolation
5. **Add input system integration** for movement animations

### **Phase 2: Animation States**
1. **Implement all 16 animation states** with proper clips
2. **Add state transition logic** and conditions
3. **Create animation blending** between states
4. **Add animation state validation** and error handling
5. **Implement animation state persistence**

### **Phase 3: Performance Optimization**
1. **Add animation culling** for distant characters
2. **Implement animation batching** for multiple characters
3. **Optimize animation updates** for 60 FPS target
4. **Add animation memory management** and cleanup
5. **Implement animation LOD** for performance

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- **State Transitions**: Verify all animation state transitions work correctly
- **Input Integration**: Test input-driven animation changes
- **Blending**: Verify smooth animation blending between states
- **Performance**: Animation update performance validation
- **Error Handling**: Test fallback behavior for missing animations

### **Integration Tests**
- **Movement Integration**: End-to-end movement and animation workflow
- **Multiplayer Sync**: Animation state synchronization across clients
- **Character Types**: Animation system works with all character types
- **Performance**: 60 FPS maintained with multiple animated characters

### **Coverage Requirements**
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage for animation system
- **Critical Paths**: State transitions, input integration, blending
- **Error Scenarios**: Missing animations, invalid states, fallback logic

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Functional Metrics**
- ✅ All 16 animation states work correctly for all character types
- ✅ Smooth transitions between animation states
- ✅ Input-driven animations respond to WASD movement
- ✅ Animation blending creates seamless state changes
- ✅ Animation state persistence works across game sessions

### **Performance Metrics**
- ✅ Animation system maintains 60 FPS target
- ✅ Animation updates < 5ms per frame
- ✅ Memory usage < 20MB for animation system
- ✅ Support for 20+ animated characters simultaneously

### **Quality Metrics**
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for animation system
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors in build
- ✅ All animation states validate successfully
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing animations

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3 (Multiple Character Models) ✅ **PENDING**
- **Dependencies**: Character model system and input system
- **Dependents**: Task 6 (Animated NPCs), Task 7 (Multiplayer Animation Sync)

### **Quality Gates**
