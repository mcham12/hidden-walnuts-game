# Task 9: Test Coverage

## 🎯 Objective

Establish comprehensive test coverage for all MVP-8a features with 90%+ coverage requirement. Implement automated testing for character systems, animation systems, NPC systems, multiplayer sync, and performance optimizations. Ensure all critical paths are tested and validated.

## 📋 Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for all new MVP-8a features
- ✅ Unit tests for all character configuration and loading systems
- ✅ Integration tests for animation systems and multiplayer sync
- ✅ Performance tests for optimization systems
- ✅ Automated test suite with CI/CD integration
- ✅ Test coverage reporting and monitoring
- ✅ Error scenario testing and validation
- ✅ Cross-browser and cross-device testing

### **Technical Requirements**
- ✅ Vitest framework for fast, reliable testing
- ✅ Test coverage reporting and thresholds
- ✅ Mock systems for network and asset loading
- ✅ Performance benchmarking and validation
- ✅ Automated test execution and reporting
- ✅ Error handling and fallback testing
- ✅ Memory leak detection and validation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Testing Framework**
```typescript
interface TestSuite {
  unitTests: UnitTestSuite;
  integrationTests: IntegrationTestSuite;
  performanceTests: PerformanceTestSuite;
  coverageReporter: CoverageReporter;
}

interface UnitTestSuite {
  characterTests: CharacterTestSuite;
  animationTests: AnimationTestSuite;
  npcTests: NPCTestSuite;
  networkTests: NetworkTestSuite;
}
```

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Coverage Tests**: Ensure comprehensive code coverage
- **Error Tests**: Validate error handling and fallbacks

### **Integration Points**
- **Character System**: Test character loading and configuration
- **Animation System**: Test animation states and transitions
- **NPC System**: Test NPC behaviors and AI
- **Multiplayer System**: Test network synchronization
- **Performance System**: Test optimization and LOD systems

### **Integration Tests**
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete character selection and animation
- **Multiplayer Scenarios**: Multi-client synchronization testing
- **Performance Scenarios**: High-load testing with 20+ characters
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, missing assets, fallback logic

### **Coverage Requirements**
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage for all MVP-8a features
- **Critical Paths**: Character loading, animation system, NPC system
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, missing assets, performance issues
