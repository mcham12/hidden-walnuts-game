# Task 3: Multiple Character Models

## 🎯 Objective

Enable support for multiple character models in the game, allowing players to select and spawn with different character types (Colobus, Gecko, Herring, Inkfish, Muskrat, Pudu, Sparrow, Taipan). Integrate character selection with the existing multiplayer system and ensure proper model loading and rendering.

## 📋 Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ Support all 8 character models (Colobus, Gecko, Herring, Inkfish, Muskrat, Pudu, Sparrow, Taipan)
- ✅ Character selection system integrated with multiplayer
- ✅ Proper model loading and rendering for each character type
- ✅ LOD (Level of Detail) support for performance optimization
- ✅ Character model switching based on selection
- ✅ Fallback to default character if selection fails
- ✅ Character model validation and error handling

### **Technical Requirements**
- ✅ Extend PlayerFactory to support character type selection
- ✅ Integrate with CharacterRegistry for character configuration
- ✅ Implement LOD model switching based on distance
- ✅ Add character model validation and error handling
- ✅ Support character model preloading for performance
- ✅ Integrate with existing multiplayer player creation
- ✅ Ensure proper model scaling and positioning

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Character Model System**
```typescript
interface CharacterModel {
  id: string;
  type: CharacterType;
  model: THREE.Group;
  lodModels: {
    lod0: THREE.Group;
    lod1: THREE.Group;
    lod2: THREE.Group;
    lod3: THREE.Group;
  };
  animations: AnimationClip[];
  textures: THREE.Texture[];
}
```

### **Integration Points**
- **PlayerFactory**: Extended to support character type selection
- **CharacterRegistry**: Provides character configuration data
- **RenderSystem**: Handles model rendering and LOD switching
- **Multiplayer System**: Syncs character type across clients
- **Asset Management**: Handles model loading and caching

## 📊 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: PlayerFactory Integration**
1. **Extend PlayerFactory** to accept character type parameter
2. **Integrate with CharacterRegistry** for character configuration
3. **Add character model loading** to player creation process
4. **Implement LOD model switching** logic
5. **Add character model validation** and error handling

### **Phase 2: Multiplayer Integration**
1. **Extend player creation** to include character type
2. **Sync character type** across multiplayer clients
3. **Handle character type changes** during gameplay
4. **Add character type validation** on server side
5. **Implement character type persistence** in player data

### **Phase 3: Performance Optimization**
1. **Implement model preloading** for selected characters
2. **Add LOD distance calculations** for model switching
3. **Optimize model memory usage** and cleanup
4. **Add model loading progress** indicators
5. **Implement model caching** for frequently used characters

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- **Character Loading**: Verify correct model loading for each character type
- **LOD Switching**: Test distance-based model switching
- **Model Validation**: Verify model integrity and scaling
- **Error Handling**: Test fallback behavior for missing models
- **Performance**: Memory usage and loading time validation

### **Integration Tests**
- **Multiplayer Sync**: Character type synchronization across clients
- **Character Selection**: End-to-end character selection workflow
- **Model Rendering**: Verify proper model display and positioning
- **Performance**: 60 FPS with multiple character types

### **Coverage Requirements**
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage for character model system
- **Critical Paths**: Model loading, LOD switching, multiplayer sync
- **Error Scenarios**: Missing models, loading failures, fallback logic

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Functional Metrics**
- ✅ All 8 character models load and render correctly
- ✅ Character selection works in multiplayer environment
- ✅ LOD system switches models based on distance
- ✅ Character models scale and position properly
- ✅ Fallback system works for missing character models

### **Performance Metrics**
- ✅ Character model loading < 500ms per character
- ✅ LOD switching < 16ms per frame
- ✅ Memory usage < 100MB for all character models
- ✅ 60 FPS maintained with 20+ characters

### **Quality Metrics**
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for character model system
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors in build
- ✅ All character models validate successfully
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing models

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: Task 1 (Character Configuration) ✅ **PENDING**, Task 2 (Model Loading) ✅ **PENDING**
- **Dependencies**: Character configuration and model loading systems
- **Dependents**: Task 4 (Player Animation System), Task 5 (Character Selection UI)

### **Quality Gates**
- **Build Validation**: All TypeScript builds must pass
- **Model Validation**: All character models must load successfully
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ coverage requirement
- **Performance**: 60 FPS target maintained
