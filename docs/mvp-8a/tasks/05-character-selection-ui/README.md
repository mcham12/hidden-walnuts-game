# Task 5: Character Selection UI

## 🎯 Objective

Create a comprehensive character selection UI that allows players to browse, preview, and select from all 8 character types (Colobus, Gecko, Herring, Inkfish, Muskrat, Pudu, Sparrow, Taipan). Implement 3D character previews, unlock progression system, and responsive design for different screen sizes.

## 📋 Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ Character gallery with 3D previews for all 8 characters
- ✅ Character selection and confirmation system
- ✅ Character unlock progression based on gameplay achievements
- ✅ Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- ✅ Character preview with rotation and zoom controls
- ✅ Character information display (name, description, unlock requirements)
- ✅ Integration with multiplayer session management
- ✅ Character selection persistence across sessions

### **Technical Requirements**
- ✅ CharacterGallery component for main selection interface
- ✅ CharacterCard component for individual character display
- ✅ CharacterPreview component for 3D character rendering
- ✅ CharacterSelectionSystem for state management
- ✅ Integration with Leaderboard for unlock progression
- ✅ Responsive CSS for different screen sizes
- ✅ 3D preview rendering with Three.js
- ✅ Character selection validation and error handling

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **UI Component Structure**
```typescript
interface CharacterSelectionUI {
  gallery: CharacterGallery;
  preview: CharacterPreview;
  selection: CharacterSelectionSystem;
  progression: UnlockProgression;
}
```

### **Character Preview System**
- **3D Rendering**: Real-time character model preview
- **Camera Controls**: Rotation, zoom, and pan controls
- **Lighting**: Proper lighting for character visualization
- **Animation Preview**: Idle animation playback in preview
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering for smooth preview

### **Integration Points**
- **CharacterRegistry**: Provides character configuration data
- **Leaderboard**: Provides unlock progression data
- **Multiplayer System**: Syncs character selection
- **Asset Management**: Loads character models for preview
- **UI System**: Handles user interactions and state

## 📊 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Core UI Components**
1. **Create CharacterGallery** component for main interface
2. **Implement CharacterCard** component for individual characters
3. **Build CharacterPreview** component for 3D rendering
4. **Add CharacterSelectionSystem** for state management
5. **Implement responsive CSS** for different screen sizes

### **Phase 2: Character Preview System**
1. **Add 3D character rendering** with Three.js
2. **Implement camera controls** for character inspection
3. **Add lighting system** for proper character visualization
4. **Integrate animation preview** with idle animations
5. **Optimize preview performance** for smooth rendering

### **Phase 3: Progression Integration**
1. **Integrate with Leaderboard** for unlock progression
2. **Add character unlock logic** based on achievements
3. **Implement character selection persistence** across sessions
4. **Add character information display** with descriptions
5. **Create character selection validation** and error handling

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- **UI Components**: Verify all UI components render correctly
- **Character Preview**: Test 3D rendering and camera controls
- **Selection Logic**: Verify character selection workflow
- **Progression System**: Test unlock logic and validation
- **Responsive Design**: Test UI on different screen sizes

### **Integration Tests**
- **Character Loading**: End-to-end character preview loading
- **Multiplayer Integration**: Character selection sync across clients
- **Progression Integration**: Unlock system with Leaderboard
- **Performance**: UI responsiveness and 3D preview performance

### **Coverage Requirements**
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage for character selection UI
- **Critical Paths**: Character preview, selection logic, progression system
- **Error Scenarios**: Missing characters, loading failures, invalid selections

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Functional Metrics**
- ✅ All 8 characters display correctly in gallery
- ✅ 3D character previews render smoothly
- ✅ Character selection works in multiplayer environment
- ✅ Unlock progression system functions correctly
- ✅ UI is responsive across different screen sizes

### **Performance Metrics**
- ✅ Character preview loading < 1s per character
- ✅ UI interactions respond < 100ms
- ✅ 3D preview maintains 30+ FPS
- ✅ Memory usage < 50MB for UI system

### **Quality Metrics**
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for character selection UI
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors in build
- ✅ All UI components validate successfully
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing characters

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: Task 3 (Multiple Character Models) ✅ **PENDING**
- **Dependencies**: Character model system and asset loading
- **Dependents**: Task 7 (Multiplayer Animation Sync), Task 8 (Performance Optimization)

### **Quality Gates**
- **Build Validation**: All TypeScript builds must pass
- **UI Validation**: All UI components must render correctly
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ coverage requirement
- **Performance**: Responsive UI and smooth 3D previews
