# Task 2: Model Loading & Asset Management

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a robust model loading and asset management system that efficiently loads 3D character models, animations, and textures. Create specialized loaders for animated models and implement asset caching for performance optimization.

## 📋 Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ Load 3D character models with LOD support
- ✅ Load character animations and blend them smoothly
- ✅ Load and apply character textures and materials
- ✅ Implement asset caching for performance
- ✅ Support animated model loading with GLTF format
- ✅ Handle asset loading errors gracefully
- ✅ Implement asset preloading for selected characters
- ✅ Support texture compression and optimization

### **Technical Requirements**
- ✅ Specialized AnimatedModelLoader for character models
- ✅ CharacterFactory for creating different character types
- ✅ Asset caching system with memory management
- ✅ LOD model switching based on distance
- ✅ Animation loading and state management
- ✅ Texture loading and material application
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Performance optimization for mobile devices

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Model Loading System**
```typescript
interface ModelLoader {
  loadModel(path: string): Promise<THREE.Group>;
  loadAnimation(path: string): Promise<THREE.AnimationClip>;
  loadTexture(path: string): Promise<THREE.Texture>;
  preloadCharacter(characterId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### **Asset Management System**
- **Caching**: Efficient memory usage with LRU cache
- **LOD Management**: Distance-based model switching
- **Preloading**: Load assets before they're needed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing assets
- **Performance**: Optimized for 60 FPS with 20+ characters

## 📊 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Core Loaders**
1. **Implement AnimatedModelLoader** for character models
2. **Create CharacterFactory** for character creation
3. **Add texture loading** and material management
4. **Implement animation loading** and state management
5. **Add LOD model switching** logic

### **Phase 2: Asset Management**
1. **Create asset caching system** with memory management
2. **Implement asset preloading** for selected characters
3. **Add asset validation** and error handling
4. **Create asset cleanup** and memory optimization
5. **Implement texture compression** and optimization

### **Phase 3: Integration**
1. **Integrate with CharacterRegistry** for character loading
2. **Add asset loading** to PlayerFactory
3. **Implement character preview** loading
4. **Add asset loading** to NPC system
5. **Create asset loading** progress indicators

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- **Model Loading**: Verify correct model loading for each character
- **Animation Loading**: Test animation clip loading and validation
- **Texture Loading**: Verify texture loading and material application
- **LOD Switching**: Test distance-based model switching
- **Asset Caching**: Verify caching behavior and memory management

### **Integration Tests**
- **Character Creation**: End-to-end character loading workflow
- **Asset Preloading**: Verify preloading for selected characters
- **Performance**: Memory usage and loading time validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing assets

### **Coverage Requirements**
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage for model loading system
- **Critical Paths**: Model loading, animation loading, LOD switching
- **Error Scenarios**: Missing assets, loading failures, fallback logic

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Functional Metrics**
- ✅ All character models load successfully with LOD support
- ✅ Character animations load and play correctly
- ✅ Character textures apply properly to models
- ✅ Asset caching reduces loading times by 50%+
- ✅ LOD system switches models based on distance

### **Performance Metrics**
- ✅ Character model loading < 500ms per character
- ✅ Animation loading < 200ms per animation set
- ✅ Memory usage < 50MB for all loaded assets
- ✅ Asset preloading completes < 2s for selected character

### **Quality Metrics**
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for model loading system
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors in build
- ✅ Graceful error handling for missing assets
- ✅ Efficient memory usage and cleanup

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **Task Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: Task 1 (Character Configuration) ✅ **PENDING**
- **Dependencies**: Character configuration system
- **Dependents**: Task 3 (Multiple Character Models), Task 4 (Player Animation System)

### **Quality Gates**
- **Build Validation**: All TypeScript builds must pass
- **Asset Validation**: All character assets must load successfully
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ coverage requirement
- **Performance**: Memory usage and loading time targets met
