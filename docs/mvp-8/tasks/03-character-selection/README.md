# Task 3: Character Selection System

## 🎯 **Objective**
Create a user interface system that allows players to choose their animal character type, with visual previews, character information, and persistent selection storage.

## 📊 **Status**
- **Status**: 📋 **PENDING**
- **Priority**: 🔵 **HIGH** (User experience foundation)
- **Dependencies**: Task 1 (Character Configuration System) 📋 **PENDING**, Task 2 (Animated Model Integration) 📋 **PENDING**
- **Estimated Time**: 1 week

## 🏗️ **Technical Requirements**

### **Character Selection UI**
```typescript
interface CharacterSelectionUI {
  showCharacterGallery(): void;
  hideCharacterGallery(): void;
  selectCharacter(characterType: string): void;
  previewCharacter(characterType: string): void;
  getSelectedCharacter(): string;
  isCharacterUnlocked(characterType: string): boolean;
}

interface CharacterPreview {
  characterType: string;
  model: THREE.Object3D;
  animations: Map<string, THREE.AnimationClip>;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentAnimation: string;
}
```

### **Character Gallery Component**
```typescript
class CharacterGallery {
  private container: HTMLDivElement;
  private characterRegistry: CharacterRegistry;
  private selectedCharacter: string = 'squirrel'; // default
  
  constructor(characterRegistry: CharacterRegistry);
  
  render(): void;
  private createCharacterCard(character: CharacterConfig): HTMLDivElement;
  private setupCharacterPreview(characterType: string): void;
  private handleCharacterSelection(characterType: string): void;
  private animateCharacterPreview(characterType: string): void;
}
```

### **Character Selection Storage**
```typescript
class CharacterSelectionManager {
  private storageKey = 'selectedCharacter';
  
  getSelectedCharacter(): string;
  setSelectedCharacter(characterType: string): void;
  hasSelectedCharacter(): boolean;
  getDefaultCharacter(): string;
  validateCharacterSelection(characterType: string): boolean;
}
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Selection System**
1. **Character Selection Manager**
   - Persistent storage of character choice
   - Validation of character selections
   - Default character fallback

2. **Character Registry Integration**
   - Access to available characters
   - Character information display
   - Unlock status management

3. **Basic UI Components**
   - Character gallery layout
   - Character information cards
   - Selection state management

### **Phase 2: Visual Preview System**
1. **3D Character Preview**
   - Real-time character model rendering
   - Animation preview system
   - Interactive camera controls

2. **Character Information Display**
   - Character statistics
   - Available animations
   - Character description

3. **Selection Feedback**
   - Visual selection indicators
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Error handling for invalid selections

### **Phase 3: Integration with Game Systems**
1. **Game Integration**
   - Character selection on game start
   - In-game character switching
   - Multiplayer character synchronization

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of character previews
   - Memory management for preview models
   - Efficient UI rendering

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

### **User Interface**
- [ ] **Character Gallery**: Visual grid of available characters
- [ ] **3D Previews**: Real-time 3D character previews
- [ ] **Character Information**: Detailed character stats and descriptions
- [ ] **Selection Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for selections

### **Character Selection**
- [ ] **Persistent Storage**: Character choice remembered across sessions
- [ ] **Validation**: Only valid characters can be selected
- [ ] **Default Fallback**: Squirrel as default if no selection
- [ ] **Multiplayer Sync**: Selected character shown to other players

### **Performance**
- [ ] **Fast Loading**: Character previews load quickly
- [ ] **Memory Efficient**: Preview models don't consume excessive memory
- [ ] **Smooth Animations**: Preview animations run at 60 FPS
- [ ] **Responsive UI**: UI responds immediately to user input

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Tests**
- **CharacterSelectionManager**: Test character selection persistence
- **CharacterGallery**: Test UI component rendering
- **CharacterPreview**: Test 3D preview functionality
- **Validation**: Test character selection validation

### **Integration Tests**
- **Game Integration**: Test character selection in game context
- **Multiplayer Sync**: Test character selection across clients
- **Performance Tests**: Test UI performance with multiple characters
- **Memory Tests**: Test memory usage of preview models

### **Test Coverage Targets**
- **CharacterSelectionManager**: 95%+ coverage
- **CharacterGallery**: 90%+ coverage
- **CharacterPreview**: 85%+ coverage
- **UI Integration**: 80%+ coverage

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate**
1. Create CharacterSelectionManager for persistence
2. Implement basic character gallery UI
3. Add character information display
4. Test with existing squirrel character

### **Short Term**
1. Implement 3D character preview system
2. Add character selection validation
3. Integrate with game startup flow
4. Add multiplayer character synchronization

### **Long Term**
1. Add character unlock system
2. Implement character customization options
3. Add character statistics and progression
4. Performance optimization for multiple characters
