# üéÆ **REVISED**: Simple MVP Plan - Core Walnut Gameplay Focus

**üéØ NEW FOCUS**: Build the **actual Hidden Walnuts game** - focus on walnut hiding/seeking mechanics and competitive multiplayer rather than character variety.

**‚úÖ Current Status**: Animated Colobus character with terrain + physics **COMPLETED** - ready for walnut gameplay!

---

## üéØ **Game Vision Alignment**

### **Core Game Loop** (from GameVision.md)
1. **Join Game** ‚Üí Get 3 walnuts to hide
2. **Hide Walnuts** ‚Üí Press H to bury/bush walnuts  
3. **Seek Walnuts** ‚Üí Find others' hidden walnuts

## ü•ú **MVP 2: Core Walnut Mechanics** üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT**

**Objective**: Implement the actual walnut hiding/seeking gameplay that defines the game.

### **Week 1: Walnut Interaction System**

**Walnut Hiding (H Key)**:
```typescript
// In Game.ts
private onHideWalnut() {
  if (this.playerWalnuts > 0) {
    // Play "Eat" animation (digging/burying)
    this.setAction('eat');
    
    // Create walnut at player position
    const walnut = this.createWalnut(this.character.position, 'buried');
    
    // Send to server
    this.sendWalnutHide(walnut);
    
    this.playerWalnuts--;
  }
}
```

**Walnut Finding (Click Detection)**:
```typescript
// Raycasting for walnut interaction
private onMouseClick(event: MouseEvent) {
  const walnut = this.getWalnutAtPosition(mousePos);
  if (walnut && this.isNearPlayer(walnut.position)) {
    // Play "Bounce" animation (excited finding)
    this.setAction('bounce');
    
    // Collect walnut
    this.collectWalnut(walnut);
    this.score += walnut.points;
  }
}
```

**Walnut Types & Scoring**:
- **Buried Walnuts**: 3 points (harder to find)
- **Bush Walnuts**: 1 point (easier to spot)
- **Game Walnuts**: Bonus multiplier
- **Visual Indicators**: Subtle terrain disturbances for buried walnuts

**Estimated Time**: **5-7 days**

### **Week 2: Basic Walnut Persistence**

**Server Integration**:
```typescript
// WebSocket walnut messages
interface WalnutMessage {
  type: 'HIDE_WALNUT' | 'FIND_WALNUT';
  walnutId: string;
  position: Vector3;
  walnutType: 'buried' | 'bush';
  playerId: string;
}
```

**Walnut State Management**:
- **WalnutRegistry Durable Object** (already exists) integration
- **Persistent Walnuts** remain after players leave
- **Walnut Ownership** tracking for scoring
- **Basic Anti-Cheat** server-side position validation

**Estimated Time**: **3-5 days**

---

## üë• **MVP 3: Competitive Multiplayer** 

**Objective**: Make it actually competitive with multiple players hiding/seeking.

### **Week 3: Multi-Player Walnut Competition**

**Real-time Player Sync**:
- **Multiple Players** see each others' characters moving
- **Walnut Stealing** - find and collect others' hidden walnuts
- **Animation Sync** - see other players' hide/seek animations
- **Proximity Rules** - can't hide/find walnuts too close to others

**Leaderboard System**:
```typescript
// Real-time scoring
interface GameScore {
  playerId: string;
  characterType: 'colobus'; // expand later
  score: number;
  wallnutsHidden: number;
  wallnutsFound: number;
  timeMultiplier: number; // 1.1x to 2x based on time played
}
```

**Competitive Mechanics**:
- **Walnut Rehiding** - steal found walnuts and hide them again
- **Score Multipliers** - time played bonus (1.1x to 2x)
- **Fresh Player Boost** - catch-up mechanic for late joiners
- **Real-time Leaderboard** updates

**Estimated Time**: **5-7 days**

---

## üåç **MVP 4: Persistent 24-Hour World**

**Objective**: Create the persistent world that resets every 24 hours.

### **Week 4: World Persistence & Daily Cycles**

**24-Hour World Cycles**:
- **Daily Reset** - forest regenerates, walnuts respawn
- **Persistent Progress** - player stats carry over
- **100 Game Walnuts** placed randomly each cycle
- **3 Walnuts per Player** when joining

**Session Management**:
- **Join Anytime** - players can enter mid-cycle  
- **Persistent Walnuts** - remain hidden when players leave
- **World State Sync** - new players see current walnut state
- **Cycle Countdown** - UI showing time until reset

**Backend Integration** (using existing Durable Objects):
- **ForestManager** - world state and daily reset logic
- **PlayerSession** - track player progress across sessions  
- **WalnutRegistry** - persistent walnut locations
- **Leaderboard** - 24-hour scoring cycles

**Estimated Time**: **5-7 days**

---

## üê∫ **MVP 5: Predators & Game Polish**

**Objective**: Add unique predator mechanics and final polish.

### **Week 5-6: Predators & Power-ups**

**Predator AI**:
```typescript
// Simple hawk/wolf behavior
class Predator {
  private targetPlayer: Player | null;
  private huntCooldown: number;
  
  update() {
    if (this.detectNearbyPlayers()) {
      this.chasePlayer();
      this.triggerPlayerFear(); // "Fear" animation
    }
  }
}
```

**Defense Mechanics**:
- **Chatter Defense** - rapid key presses to scare predators
- **Projectile Defense** - throw objects at predators  
- **Group Defense** - predators avoid multiple players

**Power-ups**:
- **Scent Sniff** - reveal nearby buried walnuts
- **Fast Dig** - hide/find walnuts quicker
- **Decoy Nut** - fake walnut that gives no points

**Game Polish**:
- **Hot Zones** - visual indicators of recent activity
- **Mini-Events** - "Nut Rush" every 4 hours
- **UI Polish** - score display, walnut counter, timer
- **Sound Effects** - digging, finding, predator sounds

**Estimated Time**: **7-10 days**
