## ü•ú MVP 3: Core Walnut Mechanics

**Goal**: Players can hide and find walnuts with proper game rules

### Part 1: Walnut Interaction (Week 1)

**Hiding Walnuts** - Press H key
```typescript
private onHideWalnut() {
  if (this.playerWalnuts > 0) {
    this.setAction('eat');  // Digging animation
    const walnut = this.createWalnut(this.character.position, 'buried');
    this.sendWalnutHide(walnut);
    this.playerWalnuts--;
  }
}
```

**Finding Walnuts** - Click on walnut
```typescript
private onMouseClick(event: MouseEvent) {
  const walnut = this.getWalnutAtPosition(mousePos);
  if (walnut && this.isNearPlayer(walnut.position)) {
    this.setAction('bounce');  // Excited animation
    this.collectWalnut(walnut);
    this.score += walnut.points;
  }
}
```

**Walnut Types & Visual Indicators**:

**1. Buried Walnuts** (3 points - harder to find)
- **Visual Clue**: Small mound of disturbed earth
  - Slightly raised terrain bump (subtle, 0.1 units high)
  - Darker soil texture where dug
  - Particle effect: tiny dirt particles occasionally puff up
  - Proximity hint: Cursor changes when hovering over area
- **Finding**: Click on mound when within 2 units
- **Difficulty**: Subtle - requires careful exploration

**2. Bush Walnuts** (1 point - easier to spot)
- **Visual Clue**: Walnut partially visible in bush foliage
  - Brown walnut shell peeking through leaves
  - Subtle glint/shimmer effect (catches light)
  - Bush leaves slightly disturbed/parted
  - Proximity hint: Cursor highlights when hovering
- **Finding**: Click on visible walnut
- **Difficulty**: Easier - visually obvious when near bush

**3. Game Walnuts** (Special bonus multiplier)
- **Visual Clue**: Golden/glowing walnut
  - Bright golden color (stands out)
  - Gentle pulsing glow effect
  - Sparkle particles around it
  - Visible from greater distance
- **Finding**: Click to collect
- **Difficulty**: Very easy - meant to be found quickly

**Detection System**:
```typescript
// Raycasting for walnut detection
interface WalnutDetection {
  // Visual feedback when player looks at walnut area
  cursorHighlight: boolean;      // Change cursor to "hand" icon
  proximityGlow: boolean;         // Faint glow when within 3 units
  soundCue: 'rustle' | 'none';   // Audio hint when very close
}
```

**Proximity Indicators** (help players know they're close):
- **Very Close** (< 1 unit): Walnut outline appears through terrain/bush
- **Close** (< 3 units): Cursor changes to search icon
- **Medium** (< 5 units): Subtle audio cue (leaves rustling for bush, dirt shifting for buried)
- **Far** (> 5 units): No indicators (pure exploration)

### Part 2: World Navigation (Week 1)

**Navigation Landmarks** - Help players orient themselves
- Colored stone towers at cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)

- Location shown in corner of screen ("Current: M12")
- Makes it easier to communicate locations

**Minimap** - Corner of screen
- Shows player positions (friendly dots)
- Landmarks marked
- Grid lines visible

### Part 3: Basic HUD (Week 1)

**Player Information Display**:
- Walnut inventory count (e.g., "Walnuts: 3")
- Current score
- Controls reminder (togglable with F key)
- Current location grid (e.g., "Location: M12")

### Part 4: Walnut Persistence (Week 2)

**Server Integration**:

interface WalnutMessage {
  type: 'HIDE_WALNUT' | 'FIND_WALNUT';
  walnutId: string;
  position: Vector3;
  walnutType: 'buried' | 'bush';
  playerId: string;
}
```

**Persistence Features**:
- Walnuts remain after players leave
- Server validates walnut positions (anti-cheat)

- Tutorial tips: "Press H to hide a walnut..." "Click to collect walnuts..."
- Achievement callouts: "First walnut hidden!" "10 walnuts found!"
- Event announcements: "New walnut available!"

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
class TutorialSystem {
  showMessage(event: 'welcome' | 'tutorial' | 'achievement' | 'hint', text: string);
  // Simple text overlay - temporary display with fade out
}
```

**Note**: Voice acting for narrator and NPCs moved to **MVP 6.5** (optional polish)

**Predator Behavior**:
```typescript
class Predator {
  update() {
    if (this.detectNearbyPlayers()) {
      this.chasePlayer();
      this.triggerPlayerFear();  // "Fear" animation
    }
  }
}
```
