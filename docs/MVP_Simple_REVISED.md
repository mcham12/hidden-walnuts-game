## ü•ú **MVP 3: Core Walnut Mechanics**

**Objective**: Implement the actual walnut hiding/seeking gameplay that defines the game.

### **Week 1: Walnut Interaction System**

**Walnut Hiding (H Key)**:
```typescript
// In Game.ts
private onHideWalnut() {
  if (this.playerWalnuts > 0) {
    // Play "Eat" animation (digging/burying)
    this.setAction('eat');
    
    // Create walnut at player position
    const walnut = this.createWalnut(this.character.position, 'buried');
    
    // Send to server
    this.sendWalnutHide(walnut);
    
    this.playerWalnuts--;
  }
}
```

**Walnut Finding (Click Detection)**:
```typescript
// Raycasting for walnut interaction
private onMouseClick(event: MouseEvent) {
  const walnut = this.getWalnutAtPosition(mousePos);
  if (walnut && this.isNearPlayer(walnut.position)) {
    // Play "Bounce" animation (excited finding)
    this.setAction('bounce');
    
    // Collect walnut
    this.collectWalnut(walnut);
    this.score += walnut.points;
  }
}
```

**Walnut Types & Scoring**:
- **Buried Walnuts**: 3 points (harder to find)
- **Bush Walnuts**: 1 point (easier to spot)
- **Game Walnuts**: Bonus multiplier
- **Visual Indicators**: Subtle terrain disturbances for buried walnuts

**Estimated Time**: **5-7 days**

### **Week 2: Basic Walnut Persistence**

**Server Integration**:
```typescript
// WebSocket walnut messages
interface WalnutMessage {
  type: 'HIDE_WALNUT' | 'FIND_WALNUT';
  walnutId: string;
  position: Vector3;
  walnutType: 'buried' | 'bush';
  playerId: string;
}
```

**Walnut State Management**:
- **WalnutRegistry Durable Object** (already exists) integration
- **Persistent Walnuts** remain after players leave
- **Walnut Ownership** tracking for scoring
- **Basic Anti-Cheat** server-side position validation

**Estimated Time**: **3-5 days**

---

## üë• **MVP 4: Competitive Multiplayer** 

**Objective**: Make it actually competitive with multiple players hiding/seeking.

### **Week 3: Multi-Player Walnut Competition**

**Real-time Player Sync**:
- **Multiple Players** see each others' characters moving
- **Walnut Stealing** - find and collect others' hidden walnuts
- **Animation Sync** - see other players' hide/seek animations
- **Proximity Rules** - can't hide/find walnuts too close to others

**Leaderboard System**:
```typescript
// Real-time scoring
interface GameScore {
  playerId: string;
  characterType: 'colobus'; // expand later
  score: number;
  wallnutsHidden: number;
  wallnutsFound: number;
  timeMultiplier: number; // 1.1x to 2x based on time played
}
```

## üóëÔ∏è **MVP 6: Code Cleanup - Remove ECS Complexity**

**Objective**: Delete all unused ECS/enterprise code that contradicts the simple architecture philosophy.

**Priority**: **Maintenance** - Remove confusion and maintain simple architecture integrity.

### **Files to Delete** (Unused ECS Architecture)
```bash
# Delete entire ECS system folders
rm -rf client/src/ecs/
rm -rf client/src/entities/ 
rm -rf client/src/systems/
rm -rf client/src/services/
rm -rf client/src/core/
rm -rf client/src/rendering/
rm -rf client/src/test/

# Delete complex orchestration files
rm client/src/GameComposition.ts
rm client/src/ENTERPRISE_ARCHITECTURE.md
rm client/src/ARCHITECTURE_README.md
rm client/src/Game\ 2.ts

# Keep simple files only
# ‚úÖ Game.ts (simple game class - 243 lines)
# ‚úÖ main.ts (simple bootstrap - 25 lines)  
# ‚úÖ terrain.ts (terrain generation)
# ‚úÖ forest.ts (forest generation)
# ‚úÖ style.css, vite-env.d.ts, types.ts
```

### **Estimated Cleanup**
- **Folders Deleted**: 8 complex folders (ecs/, entities/, systems/, services/, core/, rendering/, test/)
- **Files Deleted**: ~25+ complex files
- **Lines Removed**: ~7,000+ lines of unused complexity
- **Result**: Clean 8-file simple architecture as intended

**Estimated Time**: **1-2 hours** (careful deletion to avoid breaking Game.ts)

## üé® **MVP 6.5: Advanced Animation Smoothness** (Future Enhancement)

**Objective**: Further refine animation and movement smoothness for AAA-quality feel.

**Status**: Current implementation is functional with basic smoothness fixes applied. This MVP targets polish-level refinements.

### **Current Smoothness Implementation** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Manual Delta Time** - Replaced THREE.Clock.getDelta() with performance.now()
- ‚úÖ **Capped Frame Time** - Max 1/30s to prevent spiral of death
- ‚úÖ **Seamless Animation Loops** - Configured LoopRepeat for walk/run/idle
- ‚úÖ **Smooth Camera** - Lerp factor 0.15 for camera follow
- ‚úÖ **Continuous Velocity** - Acceleration/deceleration physics (20/15 units/s¬≤)
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Interpolation** - Removed complex extrapolation causing jitter

### **Future Refinements** (Post-Core Gameplay)

**Advanced Interpolation Techniques**:
```typescript
// Hermite spline interpolation for smoother remote players
private hermiteInterpolation(p0, p1, v0, v1, t) {
  // Smoother than linear, accounts for velocity
  return cubicHermite(p0, p1, v0, v1, t);
}

// Dead reckoning with error correction
private deadReckoning(lastState, velocity, timeSinceUpdate) {
  const predicted = lastState.position + velocity * timeSinceUpdate;
  const errorCorrection = smoothCorrect(predicted, actualPosition);
  return predicted + errorCorrection;
}
```

**Frame Time Smoothing**:
```typescript
// Rolling average of last N frames for ultra-smooth delta
private smoothedDelta() {
  this.deltaHistory.push(rawDelta);
  if (this.deltaHistory.length > 10) this.deltaHistory.shift();
  return average(this.deltaHistory);
}
```

**Input Buffering**:
```typescript
// Buffer inputs to prevent dropped frames during physics updates
private inputBuffer: InputState[] = [];
private processInputBuffer() {
  // Process all buffered inputs in order
  for (const input of this.inputBuffer) {
    this.applyInput(input);
  }
}
```

**Adaptive Interpolation**:
```typescript
// Adjust interpolation delay based on network conditions
private adaptiveDelay() {
  const jitter = calculateJitter(this.lastPackets);
  return baseDelay + (jitter * 2); // Adjust based on jitter
}
```

**Estimated Time**: **2-3 days** (when core gameplay is solid)

**Priority**: **Low** - Current smoothness is acceptable for gameplay testing. Refine after walnut mechanics proven fun.

// Simple hawk/wolf behavior
class Predator {
  private targetPlayer: Player | null;
  private huntCooldown: number;
  
  update() {
    if (this.detectNearbyPlayers()) {
      this.chasePlayer();
      this.triggerPlayerFear(); // "Fear" animation
    }
  }
}
```

**Defense Mechanics**:
- **Chatter Defense** - rapid key presses to scare predators
- **Projectile Defense** - throw objects at predators  
- **Group Defense** - predators avoid multiple players

**Power-ups**:
- **Scent Sniff** - reveal nearby buried walnuts
