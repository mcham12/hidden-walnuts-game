# üéÆ **REVISED**: Simple MVP Plan with Animated Characters

**üéØ NEW FOCUS**: Get your **amazing animated character assets** into the game **quickly** while maintaining the simplified architecture approach.

You have **8 character types** with **full animation sets** - let's use them immediately!

---

## ü¶å **Available Character Assets**

### **Character Types** (8 total)
- **Colobus** (monkey-like)
- **Gecko** (lizard)  
- **Herring** (fish)
- **Inkfish** (squid)

- **LOD1**: Medium detail 
- **LOD2**: Low detail
- **LOD3**: Minimal detail (distant)

## üöÄ **MVP Simple 1.5: Animated Players** üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT**

**Objective**: Replace basic capsule players with your **animated character assets** - fast implementation.

### **Quick Implementation Plan** (2-3 days)

**Step 1: Character Selection** (Day 1)
- Add simple character picker UI before game starts
- Let players choose from 8 character types
- Store choice in sessionStorage
- Default to random character if no choice

**Step 2: Animated Player Loading** (Day 1-2)  
- Replace capsule geometry in `Game.ts` with GLTF loader
- Load character model + animations based on selection
- Implement basic animation states: Idle ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Idle
- Use LOD0 for all players initially (optimize later)

**Step 3: Animation State Machine** (Day 2-3)
- Simple state machine: `idle`, `running`, `jumping`
- Trigger `running` animation when WASD pressed
- Return to `idle` when movement stops
- Smooth animation blending with Three.js AnimationMixer

**Step 4: Multiplayer Sync** (Day 3)
- Send character type + animation state via WebSocket
- Remote players show correct character and animations
- Sync animation state changes across clients

### **Technical Approach (Simple)**
```typescript
// In Game.ts - replace capsule with animated character
class Game {
  private animationMixer: THREE.AnimationMixer;
  private currentAnimation: THREE.AnimationAction;
  private animations = new Map<string, THREE.AnimationAction>();

  async createPlayer(characterType: string) {
    // Load character model + animations
    const gltf = await this.loadCharacter(characterType);
    
    // Setup animation mixer
    this.animationMixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(gltf.scene);
    
    // Load all animations
    gltf.animations.forEach(clip => {
      const action = this.animationMixer.clipAction(clip);
      this.animations.set(clip.name, action);
    });
    
    // Start with idle
    this.playAnimation('idle');
  }

  playAnimation(name: string) {
    const newAnimation = this.animations.get(name);
    if (newAnimation && newAnimation !== this.currentAnimation) {
      this.currentAnimation?.fadeOut(0.2);
      newAnimation.reset().fadeIn(0.2).play();
      this.currentAnimation = newAnimation;
    }
  }
}
```

**Estimated Time**: **2-3 days** (very doable!)

## ü¶å **MVP Simple 2: NPC Population** üéØ **WEEK 2**

**Objective**: Add **AI-controlled characters** roaming the forest using your animation sets.

### **Simple NPC Implementation**

**NPC Behavior** (Keep it simple):
- **Wandering**: NPCs walk randomly through forest
- **Idle States**: Occasionally stop and play idle animations (A/B/C)
- **Character Variety**: Use different character types for NPCs
- **Simple AI**: Basic waypoint system, no complex pathfinding

**Animation Usage**:
- **Walking**: Use `Run` animation at slow speed
- **Stopping**: Cycle through `Idle_A`, `Idle_B`, `Idle_C`
- **Interactions**: `Eat` animation near food sources
- **Reactions**: `Fear` animation if player gets too close

**Technical Approach**:
```typescript
class SimpleNPC {
  private targetPosition: THREE.Vector3;
  private moveSpeed = 1.0;
  private idleTimer = 0;
  private state: 'walking' | 'idle' = 'walking';

  update(deltaTime: number) {
    if (this.state === 'walking') {
      this.moveTowardsTarget(deltaTime);
      if (this.reachedTarget()) {
        this.startIdling();
      }
    } else {
      this.idleTimer += deltaTime;
      if (this.idleTimer > 3.0) { // Idle for 3 seconds
        this.pickNewTarget();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Population**: 5-10 NPCs wandering the forest for atmosphere.

**Estimated Time**: **3-4 days**

## üéÆ **MVP Simple 3: Core Walnut Gameplay** 

**Objective**: Add walnut hide/seek mechanics with **animated interactions**.

### **Walnut Interactions with Animations**
- **Hiding Walnuts**: `Eat` animation when hiding (squirrel burying)
- **Finding Walnuts**: `Bounce` animation when collecting
- **Celebration**: `Jump` animation when scoring points
- **Searching**: `Idle_B` animation when looking around

### **Enhanced Player Actions**
- **H Key**: Hide walnut (triggers `Eat` animation)
- **Click Walnut**: Collect (triggers `Bounce` animation) 
- **Score Points**: Brief `Jump` celebration
- **Look Around**: Passive `Idle` state variations

**Estimated Time**: **1-2 weeks**

---

## üèÜ **MVP Simple 4: Character Progression**

**Objective**: Make character choice meaningful and rewarding.

### **Character Abilities** (Simple differences)
- **Gecko**: Slightly faster movement (1.2x speed)
- **Sparrow**: Can "fly" (jump higher/longer)
- **Herring**: Better at finding water-area walnuts
- **Pudu**: Quieter movement (harder for others to track)
- **Colobus**: Better climbing (can reach tree walnuts)
- **Others**: Unique idle animations and visual flair

### **Unlockable Characters**
- Start with 3 characters available
- Unlock others by finding certain numbers of walnuts
- Simple progression: 10 walnuts ‚Üí unlock Gecko, etc.

**Estimated Time**: **1 week**

---

## üé® **MVP Simple 5: Animation Polish**

**Objective**: Use your **full animation library** for rich interactions.

### **Expanded Animation Usage**
- **Interaction Animations**: 
  - `Attack` for competitive walnut stealing
  - `Fear` when other players approach your hidden spots
  - `Sit` for AFK/waiting states
- **Environmental Reactions**:
  - `Fly` animation for Sparrow when jumping
  - `Swim` animation for Herring near water
  - `Spin` animation for celebration
- **Social Animations**:
  - `Clicked` animation when other players interact
  - Random `Bounce` and `Roll` animations for personality

### **Performance Optimization**
- **LOD System**: Use appropriate LOD levels based on distance
- **Animation Culling**: Don't animate characters off-screen
- **Batch Loading**: Load character assets efficiently

**Estimated Time**: **1-2 weeks**

---

## üìä **Revised Timeline**

| MVP | Focus | Time | Characters/Animations |
|-----|-------|------|----------------------|
| **Simple 1.5** | **Animated Players** | **2-3 days** | Player selection, basic animations |
| **Simple 2** | **NPC Population** | 3-4 days | AI characters with animations |
| **Simple 3** | **Walnut Gameplay** | 1-2 weeks | Interaction animations |
| **Simple 4** | **Character Progression** | 1 week | Character abilities, unlocks |
| **Simple 5** | **Animation Polish** | 1-2 weeks | Full animation library usage |

**Total**: **4-6 weeks** to fully utilize your character assets
