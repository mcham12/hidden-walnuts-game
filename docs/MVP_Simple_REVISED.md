## üéØ MVP 5.8: Startup UX + Arrow Keys + Session Management

**Goal**: Polish three critical UX issues before moving to new features

### Part 1: Startup Experience (2 hours)
**Problems**:
- No welcome screen (jumps straight to loading)
- Double loading screen (loads assets twice)
- Progress bar goes backwards (100% ‚Üí 0% ‚Üí 100%)

**Solution**:
- Add welcome/splash screen with game title
- Consolidate all asset loading into single phase
- Load once: characters, audio, environment
- Flow: Welcome ‚Üí Loading (all assets) ‚Üí Character Select ‚Üí Game

**Success**:
- Welcome screen before loading
- Single loading phase only
- Progress 0% ‚Üí 100% once
- Smooth fade transitions

### Part 2: Arrow Key Support (40 minutes)
**Goal**: Add ‚Üë‚Üê‚Üì‚Üí controls for accessibility

**Implementation**:
- Add arrow key handlers to keyboard input (same as WASD)
- Update UI to show both control schemes
- Update settings menu and control guide

**Success**:
- Arrow keys work for movement
- Both WASD and arrows work simultaneously
- UI shows both options

### Part 3: Session Management (1.5 hours)
**Goal**: Handle disconnected/abandoned players properly

**System**:
- Heartbeat every 10 seconds
- 30s no heartbeat = disconnected
- 2-minute reconnection grace period
- 5-minute full cleanup

**Visual Feedback**:
- Disconnected: 50% opacity, "Disconnected" label
- Abandoned: Fade out, remove from world

**Success**:
- Auto-disconnect after 30s
- Reconnection works seamlessly
- No ghost players in world
- Server resources freed properly

**Time Estimate**: 4 hours total

---

## üõ°Ô∏è MVP 5.9: World Boundaries ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Prevent players from falling off world edge

**Implemented**: Soft Boundaries (Option 2)

**Features**:
- Soft push-back system (gentle force toward center)
- Push zone: 10 units from edge (starts at 190 units from center)
- Push strength: Gradual increase from 0% ‚Üí 100%
- Visual feedback: Radial vignette darkens screen edges
- Warning text: "‚ö†Ô∏è Turn Back" appears when close to edge
- Smooth, AAA-quality feel (no jarring collision)
- Works in all directions (radial distance calculation)

**Deferred to MVP 9 (Audio Polish)**:
- Audio cue: Wind rustling/ambient change when approaching boundary
- Reason: Prioritizing core gameplay first, audio polish comes later

**Success Criteria** ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ Players can't walk past boundaries
- ‚úÖ Smooth collision (no jarring stops)
- ‚úÖ Works in all directions (N/S/E/W)
- ‚úÖ Subtle warning before edge (vignette + text)

**Time**: ~1 hour

---

## üîê MVP 6: Player Authentication & Identity ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Simple username system for persistent identity

**Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Username picker on first launch (PlayerIdentity Durable Object)
- ‚úÖ SessionManager with cookie + localStorage (30-day persistence)
- ‚úÖ Position persistence by sessionToken (spawn at last location)
- ‚úÖ Username system with collision handling
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard shows real usernames
- ‚úÖ Username change with cooldown (5 minutes)

**Server Architecture**:
- PlayerIdentity Durable Object for username management
- SessionToken = true identity (unique per browser)
- Username = display name (can be shared, like Discord)
- Position/character data tied to sessionToken (not username)
- Rate limiting on username changes (5 min cooldown)

**Critical Bugs Fixed**:
- Position persistence server ‚Üí client communication
- Username collision design flaw (identity theft prevention)
- Loading screen race condition (blank canvas)
- Upside-down camera flash during spawn
- Connection loop from spawn position race condition

**Cleanup Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Removed ALL client-side debug logging (Game.ts, main.ts, SessionManager.ts)
- ‚úÖ Removed verbose loading logs (audio, models, walnuts)
- ‚úÖ Removed unused variables from build
- ‚úÖ Kept only console.error/warn for critical issues

**What's Saved for Later**:
- Passwords/email (see MVP 11)
- Account recovery
- OAuth
- Cross-device sync
