# Character Implementation Guide ✅ **WORKING**

## Overview
**Status: COMPLETED** - Fully animated Colobus character with terrain-following movement, gravity physics, and proper ground positioning.

## Available Assets

### Colobus Character ✅
- **Model**: `/assets/animations/characters/Colobus_Animations.glb` (combined model + animations)
- **Animations**: idle, run, jump (automatic state switching)  
- **Scale**: 0.5 (reduced from 0.3 for better visibility)
- **Features**: 
  - Bounding box positioning (feet on ground)
  - Terrain height following
  - Gravity and jumping physics
  - Smooth animation transitions

## Implementation in Code ✅

### Character Loading & Setup
- **GLTFLoader**: Loads combined GLTF with embedded animations
- **AnimationMixer**: Handles animation blending with 0.2s transitions
- **Bounding Box**: Uses `Box3().setFromObject()` for proper ground positioning
- **Ground Offset**: Calculates `characterGroundOffset` from model bounds

### Animation States
- **idle**: Default state when not moving
- **run**: Triggered by WASD movement  
- **jump**: Triggered by Space key with gravity physics
- **Automatic Switching**: Based on movement and jumping state

### Movement & Physics
- **WASD Controls**: Directional movement with velocity
- **Gravity**: -9.8 physics simulation
- **Terrain Following**: Character Y position = `getTerrainHeight() + characterGroundOffset`
- **Camera Following**: Smooth lerp-based camera tracking

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Bounding box positioning
const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(this.character);
this.characterGroundOffset = -box.min.y;

// Terrain positioning  
this.character.position.y = getTerrainHeight(x, z) + this.characterGroundOffset;
```

Expansion Steps

Add to characters.json: New entries with model/animations.
UI: Enhance select in main.ts for multi-choice.
Multiplayer: Sync character ID/animation state via WebSocket.
NPCs: Add wandering logic with random animations.

Testing

Verify: Idle when still, run when moving, jump on space (no clipping).
Debug: Console logs for mixer updates.
