# Character Implementation Guide ✅ **WORKING**

## Overview
**Status: COMPLETED** - Fully animated character system with 11 playable characters. All characters have terrain-following movement, gravity physics, and proper ground positioning.

## Available Characters

### Character Configuration
All available characters are defined in **`/client/public/characters.json`** - this is the single source of truth for character models, animations, and metadata.

**Current Characters** (11 total):
1. **Squirrel** - Agile forest dweller (default character)
2. **Lynx** - Stealthy wildcat
3. **Goat** - Sure-footed climber
4. **Hare** - Swift speedster
5. **Moose** - Majestic forest giant
6. **Bear** - Powerful guardian
7. **Skunk** - Charismatic woodland creature
8. **Badger** - Tenacious burrower
9. **Chipmunk** - Energetic hoarder
10. **Turkey** - Proud woodland bird
11. **Mallard** - Graceful waterfowl

Each character includes:
- **Model**: LOD0 mesh (e.g., `/assets/models/characters/Squirrel_LOD0.glb`)
- **Animations**: Complete set (idle, walk, run, jump, eat, attack, sit, bounce, spin, clicked, roll, hit, fear, death, fly, swim)
- **Scale**: 0.5 for proper world proportions
- **Category**: mammal or bird
- **Emotes**: Wave, Point, Celebrate animations

## Implementation in Code ✅

### Character Loading & Setup
- **GLTFLoader**: Loads combined GLTF with embedded animations
- **AnimationMixer**: Handles animation blending with 0.2s transitions
- **Bounding Box**: Uses `Box3().setFromObject()` for proper ground positioning
- **Ground Offset**: Calculates `characterGroundOffset` from model bounds

### Animation States
- **idle**: Default state when not moving
- **run**: Triggered by WASD movement  
- **jump**: Triggered by Space key with gravity physics
- **Automatic Switching**: Based on movement and jumping state

### Movement & Physics
- **WASD Controls**: Directional movement with velocity
- **Gravity**: -9.8 physics simulation
- **Terrain Following**: Character Y position = `getTerrainHeight() + characterGroundOffset`
- **Camera Following**: Smooth lerp-based camera tracking

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Bounding box positioning
const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(this.character);
this.characterGroundOffset = -box.min.y;

// Terrain positioning  
this.character.position.y = getTerrainHeight(x, z) + this.characterGroundOffset;
```

## Adding New Characters

To add a new character to the game:

1. **Add model files** to `/client/public/assets/models/characters/`:
   - `CharacterName_LOD0.glb` (base model)

2. **Add animation files** to `/client/public/assets/models/characters/Animations/Single/`:
   - `CharacterName_Idle_A.glb`, `CharacterName_Walk.glb`, etc.

3. **Update `/client/public/characters.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "character-name",
     "name": "Display Name",
     "modelPath": "/assets/models/characters/CharacterName_LOD0.glb",
     "animations": { ... },
     "scale": 0.5,
     "category": "mammal",
     "description": "Character description"
   }
   ```

4. **Update NPC character list** in `/workers/objects/NPCManager.ts`:
   - Add the new character ID to the `CHARACTER_TYPES` array
   - Add the name mapping in `generateNPCUsername()`

The character will automatically appear in:
- Character selection screen
- Multiplayer player characters
- NPC random selection pool

Testing

Verify: Idle when still, run when moving, jump on space (no clipping).
Debug: Console logs for mixer updates.
