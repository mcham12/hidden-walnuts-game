# Revised MVP Plan for Hidden Walnuts

This plan outlines the development roadmap for *Hidden Walnuts*, a 3D multiplayer game where players hide and seek walnuts in a persistent forest environment. It reorders **Predators** to follow **Performance Optimizations** to ensure the game is visually polished and performs efficiently before adding predator mechanics. The sequence maintains logical progression while addressing priorities for a robust multiplayer foundation, walnut mechanics, and enhanced gameplay features.

## Automated Testing Infrastructure (MVP-7+)

- **Framework:** Vitest (AI-optimized, fast, and Vite-native)
- **Coverage:** 90%+ on all critical multiplayer sync and core systems
- **Philosophy:**
  - All tests are designed for AI comprehension and maintenance
  - Automated, repeatable, and coverage-enforced
  - Focus on multiplayer state sync, prediction, reconciliation, and network reliability
- **Workflow:**
  1. All new features and bugfixes must include or update automated tests
  2. Tests must pass locally (`npm run test:run`) before PR/merge
  3. Coverage reports (`npm run test:coverage`) must meet thresholds
  4. AI (Cursor) is responsible for designing, maintaining, and running all tests
- **Future MVPs:**
  - All MVPs after MVP-7 must include automated test requirements for new features
  - Test coverage and requirements must be documented in each MVP's README
