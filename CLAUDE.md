# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Hidden Walnuts**, a production-ready multiplayer 3D game where squirrels search for hidden walnuts in a procedurally generated forest. The game uses enterprise-grade architecture with professional networking patterns.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- **`client/`** - Frontend game client (Vite + TypeScript + Three.js)
- **`workers/`** - Backend services (Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects)
- **`public/assets/`** - Game assets (3D models, textures, animations)
- **`docs/`** - Documentation organized by MVP phases

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vite + TypeScript + Three.js + WebGL
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects
- **Architecture**: Entity-Component-System (ECS) + Dependency Injection
- **Networking**: Custom 5Hz multiplayer with client prediction

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start backend (run in separate terminal)
npm run dev:worker

# Start frontend (run in separate terminal) 
npm run dev:client

# Or use individual commands:
cd workers && npx wrangler dev --port 8787
cd client && npm run dev
```

### Building
```bash
# Build everything
npm run build

# Build individual components
npm run build:worker  # workers only
npm run build:client  # client only
```

### Testing
```bash
cd client
npm test              # Run tests
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Run with coverage
npm run test:run      # Run once (CI mode)
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy        # Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```

## Game Architecture (ECS Pattern)

### Entity-Component-System
The game uses a sophisticated ECS architecture with 10 systems executing in specific order:

1. **InputSystem** - Capture player input
2. **ClientPredictionSystem** - Immediate local movement prediction
3. **MovementSystem** - Remote player movement processing
4. **NetworkSystem** - Network message handling
5. **PlayerManager** - Player lifecycle management
6. **InterpolationSystem** - Smooth remote player movement
7. **AreaOfInterestSystem** - Spatial optimization
8. **RenderSystem** - Visual updates
9. **NetworkCompressionSystem** - Message batching
10. **NetworkTickSystem** - Rate-limited network updates

### Key Components
- **PositionComponent** - 3D world position
- **RotationComponent** - Rotation state
- **VelocityComponent** - Movement velocity
- **RenderComponent** - Three.js visual representation
- **NetworkComponent** - Multiplayer state
- **InterpolationComponent** - Smooth movement data

### Dependency Injection
All services use clean dependency injection via the Container system:
- Services are registered in `client/src/GameComposition.ts`
- Two-phase initialization: core services first, then scene-dependent services
- No circular dependencies

## Multiplayer Networking

### Client-Server Architecture
- **5Hz network tick rate** (optimized for free tier)
- **Client-side prediction** for zero input lag
- **Server reconciliation** with 1cm precision
- **Area of Interest** optimization (50m visibility, 100m culling)
- **Message compression** using RLE (60%+ bandwidth savings)

### Network Message Flow
1. Client captures input â†’ ClientPredictionSystem applies immediately
2. Input sent to server at 5Hz
3. Server validates and broadcasts authoritative state
4. Clients reconcile predicted state with server state

## File Organization

### Client Structure
- `client/src/main.ts` - Application entry point
- `client/src/GameComposition.ts` - Dependency injection and game management
- `client/src/ecs/` - Entity-Component-System implementation
- `client/src/systems/` - Game systems (Input, Movement, Network, etc.)
- `client/src/entities/` - Entity factories
- `client/src/core/` - Core services (EventBus, Logger, Container)
- `client/src/rendering/` - Rendering abstractions
- `client/src/services/` - Game services (TerrainService)

### Worker Structure
- `workers/api.ts` - Main worker entry point
- `workers/objects/` - Durable Objects for game state
  - `ForestManager.ts` - World state management
  - `SquirrelSession.ts` - Player state
  - `WalnutRegistry.ts` - Game objects
  - `Leaderboard.ts` - Scoring system

### Documentation Structure
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` - Main documentation index
- `docs/mvp-*/` - MVP-organized documentation
- All new docs must follow `docs/mvp-<number>/tasks/` structure

## Development Guidelines

### Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Use dependency injection for all services
- Follow ECS patterns for game logic
- Use EventBus for decoupled communication
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write production-grade logging with LogCategory

### Performance Considerations
- Game targets 60 FPS with 30 FPS minimum guarantee
- Memory usage <100MB baseline (excluding assets)
- Network optimization through compression and culling
- Asset loading is progressive with intelligent caching

### Debugging
- Use `Logger.debug(LogCategory.*, message)` for debugging
- Production builds have zero console overhead
- Test multiplayer with multiple browser windows
- Use browser DevTools for Three.js scene inspection

### Error Handling
- All systems have error boundaries with graceful degradation
- Circuit breaker pattern for automatic error recovery
- Offline mode when multiplayer unavailable
- External error reporting ready for production monitoring

### Asset Management
- 3D models in GLTF format stored in `public/assets/`
- Models have LOD versions (LOD0, LOD1, LOD2, LOD3)
- Character registry system manages available characters
- AssetManager provides caching and loading abstractions

## Testing Strategy

### Client Testing
- Unit tests for ECS components and systems
- Integration tests for multiplayer synchronization
- Performance tests for frame rate and memory usage
- Files: `client/src/test/multiplayer-*.test.ts`

### Test Commands
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:ui` - Interactive test runner
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports

## Important Notes

- **MVP Documentation Structure**: All new documentation must follow the structure in `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Two-Phase Service Registration**: Core services first, then scene-dependent services after scene initialization
- **System Execution Order**: Critical for multiplayer synchronization - do not change without understanding implications
- **Network Reconciliation**: 1cm threshold for position corrections to maintain smooth gameplay
- **Production Logging**: Use LogCategory enums and avoid console.log in production code
- **Asset Loading**: All 3D models must be loaded through AssetManager for proper caching
