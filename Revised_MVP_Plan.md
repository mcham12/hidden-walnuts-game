# Revised MVP Plan for Hidden Walnuts

## Introduction
This plan outlines the MVP stages for *Hidden Walnuts*, starting from MVP 4.5 (in progress) and extending through whole-numbered MVPs to achieve the full game vision. Each MVP focuses on a specific feature, progressing from the current basic 3D scene to a fully functional multiplayer walnut-hiding experience with daily resets, power-ups, predators, events, and social interactions.

## Game Vision Recap
- **Core Concept**: Players hide and seek walnuts in a 3D forest, earning points for finds and hides.
- **World**: A persistent forest map with trees, shrubs, and terrain, resetting every 24 hours.
- **Multiplayer**: Real-time gameplay with synchronized walnut and player positions.
- **Features**: Avatars, scoring, leaderboards, power-ups, predators, events, and social interactions.

## Current State (MVP 4.5 in Progress)
- A green "ground" with a walnut model (not hidden).
- No player avatar, trees, shrubs, or game mechanics.
- **MVP 4.5 Focus**: Deploying to Cloudflare and fixing the walnut location persistence bug.

## MVP Stages
1. **MVP 4.5: Deployment and Bug Fixing** (in progress)
2. **MVP 5: Basic Forest Environment**
3. **MVP 6: Player Avatar and Movement**
4. **MVP 7: Walnut Hiding Mechanics**
5. **MVP 8: Multiplayer Synchronization**
6. **MVP 9: Walnut Seeking and Scoring**
7. **MVP 10: Daily Map Reset**
8. **MVP 11: Power-Ups**
9. **MVP 12: Predators**
10. **MVP 13: Dynamic Events**
11. **MVP 14: Social Interactions**

- **Risk**: Resource constraints.  
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on one MVP at a time.

## Next Steps
- Complete MVP 4.5 (deployment and bug fix).
- Start MVP 5 (forest environment).
