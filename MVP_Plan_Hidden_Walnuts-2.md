# Revised MVP Plan for Hidden Walnuts

This plan outlines the development roadmap for *Hidden Walnuts*, a 3D multiplayer game where players hide and seek walnuts in a persistent forest environment. It reorders **Predators** to follow **Performance Optimizations** to ensure the game is visually polished and performs efficiently before adding predator mechanics. The sequence maintains logical progression while addressing priorities for a robust multiplayer foundation, walnut mechanics, and enhanced gameplay features.

     - `world_state`: Full state on connect, delta updates afterward
  7. **Client-Side Prediction & Reconciliation**
     - Client predicts movement locally for responsiveness
     - Server sends authoritative position corrections
     - Client reconciles differences smoothly
  8. **Interest Management**
     - Only sync players within visible range (Area of Interest)
     - Efficient message broadcasting to relevant players only
     - Handle player entering/leaving interest zones
  9. **Testing & Validation**
     - Multi-browser real-time synchronization tests
     - Network failure recovery testing
     - Position validation and anti-cheat verification
     - Performance profiling under load
- **Estimated Time**: 4-5 weeks (increased due to visual synchronization task)
- **Current Focus**: Task 3 - Multiplayer Visual Synchronization
