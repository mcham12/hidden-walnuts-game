# Revised MVP Plan for Hidden Walnuts

This plan outlines the development roadmap for *Hidden Walnuts*, a 3D multiplayer game where players hide and seek walnuts in a persistent forest environment. It reorders **Predators** to follow **Performance Optimizations** to ensure the game is visually polished and performs efficiently before adding predator mechanics. The sequence maintains logical progression while addressing priorities for a robust multiplayer foundation, walnut mechanics, and enhanced gameplay features.
